          <b>Stay in the Present Moment: </b>Try not to dwell on past job rejections. Instead, learn from these moments and focus 
                   on the present.  
                <br><br><b>Maintain Perspective: </b>It is easy to feel discouraged during the job searching process. Sometimes taking a step back 
                helps remind you that this is just one part of the journey and that it won't last forever.

        <p><b>Application Process</b><br><br><b>Don't Limit Yourself: </b>Apply to jobs even if you think you aren't
          qualified. Job postings
          often list more qualifications than are required.
          <br><br><b>Tailor Your Resume for Each Job: </b>Look for keywords in the job listing you are interested in and
          include these in
          your resume and cover letter. Do this for every application.

        <p><b>Interviews</b><br><br>
          <b>Do Your Research: </b>Learn as much about the company you are applying to as you can and show genuine
          interest during the
          interview.
          <br><br><b>Prepare Your Answers: </b>Find common questions that are asked by the company you are applying to
          and prepare your answers ahead of time.

        <p><b>Make Connections</b><br><br>
          <b>Attend a Career Fair: </b>Career Fairs are a great way to not only learn more about the jobs that are out
          there but also to build connections
          with people that are in the industry you are interested in.
          <br><br><b>Ask for Advice: </b>Focus on building authentic connections instead of asking for a job right away.
          There is a lot you can learn from your network.
          If it turns out a position is available, there is a good chance you will be considered.
